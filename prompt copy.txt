KEY RULES:
- Only include fields that have data; omit all empty fields
- Anylize the content and think critically to try to assign it to the corrcet field
- Ignore "berenson"/"fototeca" stamps such as "FOTOTECA BERENSON FIRENZE I TATTI SETTIGNANO" and "32044..." barcodes
- Front: usually Italian or english text, printed
- Back: usually English text, handwritten/printed
- Convert inches to cm (1 inch = 2.54cm)
- If there is a question mark next to text this refers to uncertainty. Please keep this as part of the transcription
- History entries as listed in order
